# mini-maya

The project contains:

1. creating of a half-edge data structure from interlinked pointers and visualization of the mesh using OpenGL vertex buffers

2. implementation of Catmull-Clark subdivision algorithm for smoothing the meshes created

3. basic skeleton joint class, implementations to bind a half-edge mesh to the skeleton, and deformation of the mesh based on the skeleton


This project creates a mesh editor application in the style of Autodesk Maya or Blender.
